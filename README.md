# Elevat0r

This single page React application introduces an simulation of a working elevator system with

## Getting Started
This project can be run locally using `npm run` from the root directory of this repository. This repository is also live-hosted at [elevat0r.com](http://elevat0r.com)

## Technology Usage
Elevat0r was built with `Create React App` and utilizes React 18 with functional components in order to construct a single-page application. An elevator system can be created through controlled inputs, with a visualization updating live.

useState was used significantly throughout the application to manage state variables and re-render illustrations based on the users input for system design.

Data is preserved through Javascript composition of a single Systems class which is composed of several nested objects representative of Elevators, Floors, Buttons, Pickups, Requests, and Stop Lists.

Additional opportunities to refactor code remain to better utilize the React Framework
* If given more time, elevator systems would be held within a useContext instance in order to encourage readability and prevent excessive prop drilling
* The asynchronous nature of updating elevator locations should be handled via React and integration of a useEffect. Instead, it was handled by VanillaJS DOM manipulation built directly into the data layer, which allowed for fast calculations, but violated React's best practices for design patterns.

## Design Rationale
## Minimizing Complexity

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
